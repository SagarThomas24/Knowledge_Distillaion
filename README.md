# Knowledge Distillation

## Introduction
**Knowledge Distillation** (KD) is a machine learning technique initially introduced by Hinton et al. in 2015, aimed at transferring knowledge from a large, complex model (known as the "teacher") to a smaller, simpler model (referred to as the "student"). This process aims to compress the teacher model's intelligence into a more efficient and compact form while retaining much of its performance capabilities. This is particularly important for deploying models in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile devices or edge computing, where computational resources are limited.

At its core, KD leverages soft labels, and probability distributions produced by the teacher model to train the student. These distributions capture richer information about class relationships than traditional "hard labels" and form the foundation for KD's success in mimicking teacher behaviors.


# Reinforcement Learning for Knowledge Distillation in Code-Switched Models

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores how **Reinforcement Learning (RL) can enhance Knowledge Distillation (KD)** for **code-switched multilingual models**. Instead of just copying the teacher model, the student **adapts dynamically** to different language distributions, improving performance across languages.

##  Why Combine RL with KD?
Traditional **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** has limitations:
- The student **only mimics the teacher** and cannot improve beyond it.
- If the teacher is biased towards a particular language, the student **inherits those biases**.
- The **loss function is fixed**, meaning the student **does not adapt dynamically**.

By integrating **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, we introduce:
 **Dynamic feedback** â€“ The student receives rewards for **correct predictions**.  
 **Self-improvement** â€“ The student **tries different learning strategies** instead of blindly copying.  
 **Environment-aware KD** â€“ The student **adjusts learning** based on real-world conditions (e.g., if a language is underperforming, it receives more distillation).  

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Idea: RL-Driven Adaptive KD
Instead of using a fixed loss function, we introduce an **RL agent** that:
1. **Observes real-world conditions** (e.g., which language needs more KD?).
2. **Adjusts distillation dynamically** (e.g., give more KD to underperforming languages).
3. **Learns over time** by **balancing multiple objectives**, such as:
   -  **Accuracy vs. Computational Cost**
   -  **Generalization vs. Specialization**
   -  **Distillation Loss vs. Task-Specific Loss**

### **Standard KD (Baseline)**
In normal KD, the student **minimizes a loss function** to match the teacherâ€™s predictions:

$$ L = \text{KL-Divergence}(P_{\text{teacher}} || P_{\text{student}}) $$

 **Issue:** The student **cannot go beyond the teacherâ€™s knowledge** and **does not adapt dynamically**.

---

### ** RL-Enhanced KD (Proposed Approach)**
We introduce **an RL agent** that **dynamically adjusts knowledge transfer**.  

#### ** Step 1: Define the RL Environment**
The RL environment consists of:
- **State:** Language distribution, task complexity, past performance.
- **Action:** Adjust the weight of KD loss for different languages.
- **Reward:** Improvement in multilingual accuracy (e.g., if Spanish performs poorly, RL increases KD weight for Spanish).

#### ** Step 2: Training with RL Feedback Loop**
The student receives **rewards/penalties** based on:
- If it **improves performance** â†’ **Reward** ðŸ“ˆ  
- If it **fails to generalize** â†’ **Penalty** ðŸ“‰  

We optimize using **Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)** to ensure smooth adaptation.

##  Example: Code-Switched Sentiment Analysis
Imagine training a **sentiment analysis model** for **English-Spanish code-switched data**.  
- In normal KD, the student **copies all knowledge equally** from the teacher.  
- With RL-KD, the student **prioritizes underperforming parts** (e.g., if sentiment detection in Spanish is weak, RL **increases KD focus on Spanish**).  

---

##  Why This Matters
 **Better multilingual adaptation** â€“ No more **one-size-fits-all KD**.  
 **Handles low-resource languages** â€“ The student **learns where it is weak** and adjusts accordingly.  
 **Improves beyond the teacher** â€“ The model can **discover better reasoning patterns** than the teacher provided.  

---

##  Implementation Plan
1. **Baseline:** Train a multilingual **teacher model** and a **student model** using traditional KD.
2. **RL Setup:** Implement an **RL agent** to adjust KD weights dynamically.
3. **Reward Design:** Define a reward function based on **language accuracy gains**.
4. **Train & Evaluate:** Compare **RL-KD vs. Standard KD** on multilingual tasks.

## Challenges in Applying KD to LLMs
Despite its advantages, applying KD to Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unique challenges:

- **Transfer Gap**: The student model often struggles to match the teacher's nuanced understanding, especially in complex reasoning tasks.
- **Training Complexity**: Advanced KD techniques like DSKD require sophisticated setups, including cross-model attention and intermediate layer alignment.
- **Data Dependency**: KD's effectiveness heavily relies on high-quality, task-specific data, making it less adaptable to low-resource settings.
- **Emergent Behaviors**: Larger models exhibit capabilities that are not explicitly trained for, which are difficult to transfer to smaller models.
